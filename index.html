                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Hello there! I'm Kwizera Omer, a multifaceted professional passionate about architectural design and software engineering. As a student pursuing dual degrees at the University of Rwanda in architecture and African Leadership University in software engineering, I thrive on the unique intersection of creativity and technology. With a solid foundation in architecture, I possess a keen eye for aesthetics, spatial design, and sustainable solutions. I enjoy conceptualizing and crafting visually captivating buildings that not only fulfill functional requirements but also create meaningful experiences for occupants. Simultaneously, my journey into software engineering has expanded my horizons and ignited a fascination for the ever-evolving tech landscape. As a front-end developer, I create intuitive and immersive user interfaces that seamlessly blend form and function. I strive to leverage technology to enhance how people interact with the built environment, enriching their lives through seamless digital experiences. Driven by curiosity and a desire to impact positively, I constantly seek opportunities to push boundaries and challenge conventional norms. Through my personal portfolio, I aim to showcase my expertise, demonstrate my versatility, and inspire others with my unique blend of architectural finesse and software engineering</p><br>
                <strong>Join me on this exciting journey as we redefine the boundaries of design and technology, one project at a time.</strong>
